    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>A coding student from South Africa</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      <p>
        Learning to code has been an incredibly empowering experience for me as
        a woman. Not only has it opened doors to new career opportunities and
        financial stability, but it's also given me a sense of confidence and
        creativity. Coding allows me to bring my ideas to life and solve
        real-world problems, which is an amazing feeling. Plus, being part of a
        growing community of women in tech has connected me with inspiring
        mentors and role models who support and motivate me every step of the
        way. Overall, coding has been a game-changer for me, and I encourage all
        women to give it a try! In South Africa, a growing number of women are
        breaking down barriers and stereotypes in the tech industry by learning
        to code and pursuing careers in software development. Organizations are
        providing training, mentorship, and support to help women develop their
        coding skills and build confidence in their abilities. As a result, more
        women are taking on leadership roles in tech companies, starting their
        own businesses, and creating innovative solutions to address social and
        economic challenges in their communities. By increasing diversity in the
        tech sector, these women are not only empowering themselves but also
        contributing to a more inclusive and vibrant digital economy in South
        Africa.
